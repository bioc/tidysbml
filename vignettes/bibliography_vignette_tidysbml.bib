	abstract = {The Reactome Knowledgebase (https://reactome.org), an Elixir and GCBR core biological data resource, provides manually curated molecular details of a broad range of normal and disease-related biological processes. Processes are annotated as an ordered network of molecular transformations in a single consistent data model. Reactome thus functions both as a digital archive of manually curated human biological processes and as a tool for discovering functional relationships in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic mutation catalogs from tumor cells. Here we review progress towards annotation of the entire human proteome, targeted annotation of disease-causing genetic variants of proteins and of small-molecule drugs in a pathway context, and towards supporting explicit annotation of cell- and tissue-specific pathways. Finally, we briefly discuss issues involved in making Reactome more fully interoperable with other related resources such as the Gene Ontology and maintaining the resulting community resource network.},

	abstract = {RCy3 is an R package in Bioconductor that communicates with Cytoscape via its REST API, providing access to the full feature set of Cytoscape from within the R programming environment. RCy3 has been redesigned to streamline its usage and future development as part of a broader Cytoscape Automation effort. Over 100 new functions have been added, including dozens of helper functions specifically for intuitive data overlay operations. Over 40 Cytoscape apps have implemented automation support so far, making hundreds of additional operations accessible via RCy3. Two-way conversion with networks from {\textbackslash}textit\{igraph\} and {\textbackslash}textit\{graph\} ensures interoperability with existing network biology workflows and dozens of other Bioconductor packages. These capabilities are demonstrated in a series of use cases involving public databases, enrichment analysis pipelines, shortest path algorithms and more. With RCy3, bioinformaticians will be able to quickly deliver reproducible network biology workflows as integrations of Cytoscape functions, complex custom analyses and other R packages.},

	abstract = {Summary:  biomaRt is a new Bioconductor package that integrates BioMart data resources with data analysis software in Bioconductor. It can annotate a wide range of gene or gene product identifiers (e.g. Entrez-Gene and Affymetrix probe identifiers) with information such as gene symbol, chromosomal coordinates, Gene Ontology and OMIM annotation. Furthermore biomaRt enables retrieval of genomic sequences and single nucleotide polymorphism information, which can be used in data analysis. Fast and up-to-date data retrieval is possible as the package executes direct SQL queries to the BioMart databases (e.g. Ensembl). The biomaRt package provides a tight integration of large, public or locally installed BioMart databases with data analysis in Bioconductor creating a powerful environment for biological data mining.Availability:  http://www.bioconductor.org.
